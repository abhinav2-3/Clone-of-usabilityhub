Project Name: UsabilityHub Clone
This is my first project using HTML and CSS, and it is a clone of the UsabilityHub website. UsabilityHub is a platform that offers various tools for remote user testing, such as surveys, click tests, and navigation tests.

Description
In this project, I have tried to replicate the design and layout of the UsabilityHub website using HTML and CSS. I have used various CSS techniques such as flexbox to create a frontend design that looks great on desktop.
